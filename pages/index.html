<h1>BEWARE OF THE DEEP WEB: ENTER AT YOUR OWN COST</h1>

    <p> While it is not always possible to directly discover a specific web server's content so that it may be indexed, a site potentially can be accessed indirectly (due to computer vulnerabilities).

To discover content on the web, search engines use web crawlers that follow hyperlinks through known protocol virtual port numbers. This technique is ideal for discovering content on the surface web but is often ineffective at finding deep web content.
 For example, these crawlers do not attempt to find dynamic pages that are the result of database queries due to the indeterminate number of queries that are possible. It has been noted that this can
 be (partially) overcome by providing links to query results, but this could unintentionally inflate the popularity for a member of the deep web. <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3249765/what-is-the-dark-web-how-to-access-it-and-what-youll-find.html">Find out more about the deeb web</a></p>
